## Problem Statement
While there are many test management products available today, none are designed with Agile, DevOps, or Automation in mind. It requires significant time and effort to customize an existing test management product to adopt the increasing needs of Agile and Automation. These products are not only counter-productive, but also cost an absurd amount per year. Testctrl aims to break into the market with the first ever open-source, enterprise-ready, and agile-first solution.

## Roadmap
**\[Define]** -> Design -> MVP -> Iterate -> Release

### Define
Write a problem statement to reflect the purpose of this project.

### Design
Model user interface mockups, API interfaces, and database schemas. 

### MVP
Build a test management product with the core features.

### Iterate
Develop more features prioritized for a v1 release.

### Release
Release a stable verson 1.0.0!

## Contributing
Currently testctrl is not looking for contributions until version 1.0.0 is released. However,  we are excited to backlog your ideas and feature suggestions.

## License
While we want to provide an open-source product, we value a community centered around improving one codebase. Please do not fork this repository with the purpose of rebranding and redistributing it. See the license attached to this repository for more details.
