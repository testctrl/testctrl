## Problem Statement
While there are many test management products available today, none are designed with Agile, DevOps, or Automation in mind. It requires significant time and effort to customize an existing solution to adopt the increasing needs of Agile and Automation. These tools are not only counter-productive, but also absurdly expensive. TestCtrl aims to disrupt the market by providing the world's first *community-driven*, *enterprise-ready*, and *agile-based* solution.

## Features
The goal of TestCtrl is to offer all the features you need right out of the box:
- Highly collaborative environment for agile-based testing
- Integrations for all popular test automation frameworks
- Extensive test case configuration, templates
- Built-in quality KPIs and metrics, custom dashboarding
- Role-based user access, OAuth and social login
- Intuitive, engaging, predictable user interface
- Easily deployed and self-managed, no strings attached
- Continuously evolving features via community-driven development
