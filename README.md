## Problem Statement
While there are many test management products available today, none are designed with Agile, DevOps, or Automation in mind. It requires significant time and effort to customize an existing test management product to adopt the increasing needs of Agile and Automation. These products are not only counter-productive, but also cost an absurd amount per year. Testctrl aims to break into the market with the first ever open-source, enterprise-ready, and agile-first solution.
